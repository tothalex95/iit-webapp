# IIT Webapp Angular Project

It's a hobby project using [Angular 6](https://angular.io/). I started to develop this application in order to replace the one, I previously used as my university website, written in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

## Building the application

Despite using Angular 6, I don't use the updated CLI. As I'm new to Angular, I wanted to learn it step-by-step, configuring and building everything manually. For compiling and building the application I use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Run `npm install` to download and install the necessary dependencies.

Run `npm run build` to build the application.
